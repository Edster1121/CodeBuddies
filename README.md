# CodeBuddies
A game about solving puzzles in a fun and collaborative way!

Drawing from our personal experiences in education and recognizing the gap in products designed to develop computational thinking skills, we were inspired to create something for kids. Our goal was to design a game that makes learning computational thinking both fun and accessible. CodeBuddies was created to foster teamwork, creativity, and logical problem-solving.
